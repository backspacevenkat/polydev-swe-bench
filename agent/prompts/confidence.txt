You are an expert software engineer assessing your confidence in a proposed solution.

## Task
Critically evaluate the following proposed solution and provide a confidence score.

## Proposed Solution
{proposed_solution}

## Instructions
Rate your confidence in this solution on a scale of 1-10:
- 1-3: Low confidence - significant uncertainties or likely issues
- 4-5: Below average - some concerns or unknowns
- 6-7: Moderate - reasonable solution but some risks
- 8-9: High confidence - solid solution with minor uncertainties
- 10: Very high confidence - certain this is correct

## Output Format

Provide your assessment in XML tags:

<confidence_score>[1-10]</confidence_score>

<confidence_reasoning>

<uncertainties>
- [Uncertainty 1]
- [Uncertainty 2]
